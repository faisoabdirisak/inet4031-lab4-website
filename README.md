# Lab 4 - HTML and JavaScript Practice

This repository contains my work for Lab 4.  
It includes an HTML page that demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to interact with a webpage.  
On my page, you can click buttons to turn a lightbulb image on and off.  

Changes I made to make the page unique:
- Added my name to the heading
- Changed the background color
- Updated the text to tell users to click on button below to turn the light on and off.
